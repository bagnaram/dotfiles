#+TITLE: dotfiles
These are my dotfiles, or in other words, a collection of configuration for
various applications. All stored in a single repository. The idea is you clone a
single repo, and can install the configuration using various make targets.

* Installation
1. Clone this repository
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results verbatim :exports both
  git clone https://github.com/bagnaram/dotfiles.git

2. Enter the cloned directory and pull each of the sub-modules
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results verbatim :exports both

   will create symlinks to all the configuration files within the dotfiles
